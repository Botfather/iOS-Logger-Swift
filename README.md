# iOS-Logger-Swift 

Just started learning swift! Thought of making some Utils while learning ðŸ˜€ 

## Usage 

Import the Logger.swift file to your project and that's it!

Set Log Levels and Output Medium from the Logger.swift file itself

``` swift
Logger.info("Information")
Logger.warn("Warnings")
Logger.parse("Parsing Info")
Logger.error("Error")
```
